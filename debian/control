Description: AWS Greengrass edge compute package
 AWS Greengrass is software that lets you run local compute, messaging, data
 caching, sync, and ML inference capabilities for connected devices in a secure
 way. With AWS Greengrass, connected devices can run AWS Lambda functions, keep
 device data in sync, and communicate with other devices securely â€“ even when
 not connected to the Internet. Using AWS Lambda, Greengrass ensures your IoT
 devices can respond quickly to local events, use Lambda functions running on
 Greengrass Core to interact with local resources, operate with intermittent
 connections, stay updated with over the air updates, and minimize the cost of
 transmitting IoT data to the cloud.
